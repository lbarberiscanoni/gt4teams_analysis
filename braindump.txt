ok

I have a lot of data

I have data from 1 game 

hawk-dove is about aggression 

there is an incentive to be a victim, so aggression is more indicative of a zero-sum mentality 

should I calculate the average score?

I have the total for every round

Should I try to identify sequences of cooperation
	What kind fo statstic test would prove they are significant? 

I can probalby easily track the 4 quadrants to show at a more granular level what's happening 
	At a high level, I should track how cooperative they are 

main comparision is human-vs-AI expectation 

plot the distribution of values overall for each game 
	yes, so 3 separate distributions

compare each model and see if it's significant 

it's not a logistic regression

how would I go about proving that they are either more cooperative or more hostile? 
	compare the means of the two? 

try to see if cooperation increases over time? 
	also say that it might not be significant 

two seprate condtions [truth, lie]
	think about truth first 

histograms would be good because the values are discrete 

-----

Plan 

for each model
	for each set
		plot histogram of values 


compare the mean of attack among models

compare the mean of peace among models

for each quadrant
	compare mean of quadrant among models 

for [cooperation, defection]:
	for each turn 
		plot linegraph of mean 
		CI 

contrast human vs AI
	for each turn 
		for each quadrant
			compare human average vs AI average by the human


---- consensus --- 

for [cumulative, by-turn]

	for each quadrant
		contrast each model condition

	for [attack, peace]
		constrast the average of the models

	for [attack, peace]
		constrast the average of the humans with each model

	for [attack, peace]
			compare human-v-human and human-v-AI

logistical models
	

	attack vs peace first turn --> attack-peace ratio overall (positive, negative)

	attack + peace ratio first game --> attack-peace ratio overall 

	for each quadrant

		all quadrants first game --> quadrant ratio overall
