I have a lot of data

I have data from 1 game 

hawk-dove is about aggression 

there is an incentive to be a victim, so aggression is more indicative of a zero-sum mentality 

should I calculate the average score?

I have the total for every round

Should I try to identify sequences of cooperation
	What kind fo statstic test would prove they are significant? 

I can probalby easily track the 4 quadrants to show at a more granular level what's happening 
	At a high level, I should track how cooperative they are 

main comparision is human-vs-AI expectation 

plot the distribution of values overall for each game 
	yes, so 3 separate distributions

compare each model and see if it's significant 

it's not a logistic regression

how would I go about proving that they are either more cooperative or more hostile? 
	compare the means of the two? 

try to see if cooperation increases over time? 
	also say that it might not be significant 

two seprate condtions [truth, lie]
	think about truth first 

histograms would be good because the values are discrete 

----- Plan -----

for each model
	for each set
		plot histogram of values 


compare the mean of attack among models

compare the mean of peace among models

for each quadrant
	compare mean of quadrant among models 

for [cooperation, defection]:
	for each turn 
		plot linegraph of mean 
		CI 

contrast human vs AI
	for each turn 
		for each quadrant
			compare human average vs AI average by the human

what woudl be some cool graphs
	I guess I could do histograms
	But does that stuff matter in terms of a sequence? 
	linear model 
	is there anything else?

what do I need the matrix to look like for R to work?
